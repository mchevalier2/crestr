\arguments{
\item{taxa.name}{A vector that contains the names of the taxa to study.}

\item{taxaType}{A numerical index (between 1 and 6) to define the type of
palaeoproxy used: 1 for plants, 2 for beetles, 3 for
foraminifers, 4 for diatoms, 5 for chironomids and 6 for
rodents. The example dataset uses taxaType=0. Default is 1.}

\item{climate}{A vector of the climate variables to extract. See
\code{\link{accClimateVariables}} for the list of accepted values.}

\item{pse}{A pollen-Species equivalency table. See \code{\link{get_pse}} for
details.}

\item{continents}{A vector of the continent names defining the study area.}

\item{countries}{A vector of the country names defining the study area.}

\item{realms}{A vector of the studied botanical realms defining the study area.}

\item{biomes}{A vector of the studied botanical biomes defining the study area.}

\item{ecoregions}{A vector of the studied botanical ecoregions defining the
study area.}

\item{xmn, xmx, ymn, ymx}{The coordinates defining the study area.}

\item{df}{A data frame containing the data to reconstruct (counts,
percentages or presence/absence data).}

\item{x}{The name, age or depth of the rows of df (the samples).}

\item{x.name}{A string describing the x axis (e.g. 'Sample Name', 'Age',
'Depth').}

\item{minGridCells}{The minimum number of unique presence data necessary to
estimate a species' climate response. Default is 20.}

\item{bin_width}{The width of the bins used to correct for unbalanced climate
state. Use values that split the studied climate gradient in
15-25 classes (e.g. 2Â°C for temperature variables). Default is 1.}

\item{shape}{The imposed shape of the species pdfs. We recommend using
'normal' for temperature variables and 'lognormal' for the
variables that can only take positive values, such as
precipitation or aridity. Default is 'normal' for all.}

\item{npoints}{The number of points to be used to fit the pdfs. Default 200.}

\item{geoWeighting}{A boolean to indicate if the species should be weighting
by the squareroot of their extension when estimating a genus/family
level taxon-climate relationships.}

\item{climateSpaceWeighting}{A boolean to indicate if the species pdfs should
be corrected for the modern distribution of the climate space (default
TRUE).}

\item{selectedTaxa}{A data frame assigns which taxa should be used for each
variable (1 if the taxon should be used, 0 otherwise). The colnames
should be the climate variables' names and the rownames the taxa
names. Default is 1 for all taxa and all variables.}

\item{presenceThreshold}{All values above that threshold will be used in the
reconstruction (e.g. if set at 1, all percentages below 1 will be set
to 0 and the associated presences discarded). Default is 0.}

\item{taxWeight}{One value among the following: 'originalData',
'presence/absence', 'percentages' or 'normalisation' (default).}

\item{uncertainties}{A (vector of) threshold value(s) indicating the error
bars that should be calculated (default both 50 and 95\% ranges).}
