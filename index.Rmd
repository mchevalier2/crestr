# **crestr** A R package to perform probabilistic palaeoclimate reconstructions from fossil bioproxies

The goal of crestr is to produce probabilistic reconstructions of past  climate
change from fossil assemblage data. The approach is based on the estimation of
conditional responses of studies bioproxy studied to climate paramters. These
responses take the form of probability density functions (*pdfs*). The details
of the method have been described in [Chevalier *et al.* (2014)](http://www.doi.org/10.5194/cp-10-2081-2014)
and the calibrated data presented in [Chevalier (2019)](http://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.01.016).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


``` r
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mchevalier2/crestr")
```


## Example applications



```{r img1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center', out.extra='style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mchevalier2/crestr/master/webpage/example-app.png")
```

The diamonds represent the location of pollen records used to generate the reconstructions presented in B-D and the coloured boxes represent the extent of their respective calibration zones. (B) Annual precipitation reconstructions from Lake Van, Turkey, (C) Mean annual temperature reconstruction from Laguna de Fùquene, Colombia (unpublished) and (D) Mean Annual temperature reconstruction from marine core MD96-2048._
