The goal of crestr is to produce probabilistic reconstructions of past climate
change from fossil assemblage data. The approach is based on the estimation of
conditional responses of studies bioproxy studied to climate paramters. These
responses take the form of probability density functions (*pdfs*). The details
of the method have been described in [Chevalier *et al.* (2014)](http://www.doi.org/10.5194/cp-10-2081-2014)
and the calibrated data presented in [Chevalier (2019)](http://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.01.016).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mchevalier2/crestr")
```
> **_NOTE:_**  This package is still in an **early phase of development**. The
documentation is sparse and the functionalities limited. If you notice any bug,
or if you would like to see some specific functions implemented, feel free to contact
me at <chevalier.manuel@gmail.com>. I will try to limit as much as possible
modifying existing functions and/or function parameters, but at the moment it
cannot be excluded. My apologies for this.

## Example



```{r setup}
library(crestr)
```
