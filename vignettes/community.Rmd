As the crest community has been rapidly growing since the release of the _crestr_ package and associated publication last year, I created a mailing list of crest-interested users to share information more efficiently. Controlled and limited communication through this channel are guaranteed since we all receive too many emails already.  To join the mailing list, you only need to enter your name and contact below (feel free to share this link with your colleagues and students who may be interested). Emails will include the following information:

- Early notifications of upcoming workshops to allow you to secure spots (independent online events or associated with international congresses);
- Publication highlights of studies involving crest (please send me your publication(s) if you want your work advertised here!);
- Notifications about important updates of the crestr R package (bug fixing, new features, new vignettes, etc.);
- Communications from crest/r members relevant to this community.
